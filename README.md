#### 1. What are APIS? <br>
 An API is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system. 
 There are countless types of APIs available today, spanning across different industries and contexts. 
 For example, APIs can be used to access weather data, financial information, social media platforms, and more.

 Let's say you want to create a crime map of London and need crime data to do so. 
 However, the police won't provide all the details of crime data because it is confidential. 
 Instead, authorized personnel can access this data, but they may be willing to provide basic information such as where the crime happened and 
 when it occurred, which you could read about in the news. 
 APIs act like a contract between users and data providers, specifying how much data can be revealed and how users can access and manipulate 
 that data to create software or websites.

 APIs are designed to be easy to use, just like ordering from a restaurant menu. 
 When you order a pizza at a pizza restaurant, the server will respond by serving you the pizza. 
 Similarly, when a user sends a request to an API, the server will respond with the requested data if the request is correct. 
 Otherwise, the server won't respond!
